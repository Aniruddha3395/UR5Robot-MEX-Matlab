# UR5Display
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pradeepunique1989/UR5Display/master/docs/image.png)

This repository contains a MATLAB class to display an UR5 robot.
There are many ways to visualize a robot model in MATLAB.
This class does it efficiently by utilizing "hgtransform" objects provided by MATLAB.

I hope this class is of use to anyone wanting to:
1) Visualize the pose of an UR5 robot.
2) Visualize and manipulate STL objects efficiently from within MATLAB.
